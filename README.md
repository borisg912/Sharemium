# Sharemium
 A Windows UWP sharing assistant
 
 The perfect assistant for sharing content easily from your browser to your favourite UWP apps, working with earlier versions of Windows, including 10240 RTM

### Here's 3 cents:
- My first actual UWP C# app :)
- Waiting until v1.0 to upload to Store
- Working on a Chromium (Chrome, Brave, Opera) extension

### My 2 free cents:
- Anyone can contribute or give notes/suggestions/feedback
- The app is as-is, no warranty, no guarantee, no nuthin'

#### Credits and thanks
