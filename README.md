 ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borisg912/Sharemium/main/Assets/RawLogo200x200.png)# Sharemium#### A Windows UWP sharing assistant The perfect extension-program duo for sharing content from your browser to your favorite UWP apps with ease### ❔ How it works?The app works by getting the website link and protocol parameters from the 'sharemium:' URI, called by the extension.The link is automatically formatted to include the http/https extension, and then carried over to the Windows Sharing dialog. The URI structure follows this simple scheme: <code>sharemium:__website.com/path__#title=__Site title__&descr=__A simple website__</code>### 💻 How to install1. __Download the app__     1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/borisg912/Sharemium/releases) page.     2. Find and download the latest .appxbundle and the .cer files for the app.     3. Find and download the latest .crx for the Chromium extension.          * Only for Chrome, Vivaldi and Brave: Download the [ChromiumRegistryFix.reg](https://https://github.com/borisg912/Sharemium/tree/main/Sharemium.Extensions) registry policy entry to enable the extension.2. __Install the app and its certificate__     1. Open your file manager of choice, right-click the .cer certificate and click __Install certificate__.          * If you're installing the app on a Windows 10 Team or Mobile, you need to double-click the file.     2. From the window select __Current User__ > Next > __Place all certificates in the following store__ > Browse > __Trusted People__ > Next > Finish.     3. Double-click the .appx installer select __Install__.3. __Install the Extension - Chromium__     1. Open your Chromium browser of choice (Chrome, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi) and go to the extensions page, usualy at [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).     2. Open your file manager of choice, grab the .crx file with your mouse and drag it over to the extensions page of your browser. When prompted, select __Add extension__.          * Only for Chrome, Vivaldi and Brave: Open your file manager, right-click the _ChromiumRegistryFix.reg_ file, click __Merge__ > Yes, then close and reopen all windows of your browser.          * Only for Opera: There is a chance the extension will auto-install when downloaded. In that case, just follow the popup to the [opera://extensions](opera://extensions) page and click __Install__.     5. The first time you use the extension, it will ask if it can open the UWP app. You can click __Always allow__ to hide that popup. ⚠ The extension will not open the app without your knowledge.### 📤 How to use?1. __To share the current page you're on__     * Right-click on an empty space on the page and select __Share this page__;2. __To share a hyperlink__     * Right-click on the link and select __Share this link__;After this, the app will open and great you with the sharing dialog. After you select the app you want, the app has a 15-second countdown with a progress indicator, after which the app auto-closes.This is because there is no native way to see if the dialog is open or closed, or if the sharing has gone through successfully. ✅ In the future, the timer will be customizable by the user.### ⚠ Important notes and known problems* FTP Shares     * When sharing a link with an _ftp://_ or _ftps://_ the app automatically adds the _https://_ extension to the URL as it cannot recognize it. _(https://ftp//example.com)_     * I am working on finding a workaround for this edge case.* Browser Extensions     * Currently there is only an extension for Chromium browser, which is still in Beta.     * I plan to release a Gecko add-on (Firefox, Floorp, Mullvad) later on.#### 📝 Notices* My first actual UWP C# app :)* For suggestions and bug feedback use the Issu4es in GitHub and set tag:     * Bug/Error     * New feature/design requests     * Appx Package Issue* Everyone is free to contribute to the project or use it as a reference for a personal one.* The app won't be published to the Microsoft Store, but the extensions might be uploaded on the Opera and Firefox Add-on stores.#### 🙏 Credits* [faisalman] for [ua-parser-js] - used in the extension for advanced browser identification* [Empyreal96] for [Appx Re-Sign]  - used for appx package signing[faisalman]: <https://github.com/faisalman>[ua-parser-js]: <https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js>[Empyreal96]: <https://github.com/Empyreal96>[Appx Re-Sign]: <https://github.com/Empyreal96/Appx_Re-Sign>
